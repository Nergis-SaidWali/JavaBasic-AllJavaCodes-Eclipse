Logical Operators:
	Logical operators help us test more than one condition. In Java, we have && 'AND' operator, || 'OR' operator and ! 'NOT' operator.
	
Why we should learn Logical Operators?
	Logical operators help us reduce the number of if-conditions that we write in certain cases.
	
What is the syntax?
	if(condition && condition2) {
	
	}
	
	I can replace nested if conditions with logical && 'AND' operator. Logical || 'OR' can be replaced with if else if conditions.
