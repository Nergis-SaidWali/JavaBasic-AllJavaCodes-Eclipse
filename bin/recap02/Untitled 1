Type Casting(primitive data types):

Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
For example; we can convert a short to byte, a long to a float.
There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual

Implicit/widening/automatic Type casting:
	When Java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happends when we assign
a smaller data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this conversion.

Explicit/narrowing/manual Type casting:
	When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called Explicit/narrowing/Manual. It doesn't
happen automatically we have to do it explicitly Manually.

Why do we use type casting?
	It may happen when lot of people are working in a project and each of them are using different data type. 
In that case if we have to merge it , then we do this.

Why should we learn type casting?
	When we write code in our real life most of the time, we use the code from others to save time and we might also need to
convert the data types to make our code compatible with their code.
when the types of variables are different in 3,00,000 lines of code so we don't have to
change it just because we are using something different.

What is the syntax for type casting?
	We use () and inside the () we write the destination data type. 
For example: if we want to convert a long to an int, this is how we do it;
long var1=250;
int var2=(int)var1; (it's an explicit type casting)
double var3=var2

Float f=250.5f;
double d=f;//implicit/widening/automatic

If else conditions
	if else conditions hep us to write code that can take the decision based on data.
Why should we learn about if else?
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website
our programs need to make a lot of decisions.

IF (the given username and password matches) {go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}

What is the syntax for If else conditions?

			boolean isHungry=true;
			If(isHungry){
			System.out.println("Please eat something");
			}else{
			System.out.println("Lets build some java programs")
			}
