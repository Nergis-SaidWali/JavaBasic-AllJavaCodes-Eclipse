Java Class 7

switch Syntax

switch (variable)

case value1: {
	code A;
	break;
case value2:
	code B;
	break;
default:
	code C;
	break;
}

Switch case's limitations:\
Some data types cannot be used; double, float, long and boolean
Logical and Relational Operators cannot be used


Loops -

int time=11;

if(time<12) {
System.out.println("Good Morning!);
}

while(time<12) {
System.out.println("Good morning);
}


while loop syntax

while(boolean condition) {
	System.out.println(code to be repeated);
	}
	
	
	do while loop
	
	
	do while loop syntax
	
	do {
		code to be repeated;
		}while(boolean condition);
		
		while vs do while ---> both loops executed while conditions is true
		
		while loop first CHECK the condition - > if the condition is true - > executes code
		do while first EXECUTES the code -> then checks condition
		
	for loop syntax -
	
	for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	code to be repeated;
	}
	
	//Hello 5 times
	
	for(int i=1; i<=5; i++) {
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
	
	When we know in advance how many times to repeat a block of code -> USE FOR LOOP
	When we do not know in advance how many times to repEat a block of cOde -> USE WHILE OR DO WHILE LOOP
