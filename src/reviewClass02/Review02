Type Casting:
Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another one.
we have two types of type casting;
1. Explicit/Narrowing/Manual ( we are going from smaller to larger)
	int box=1000;
	byte box2=(byte) box;
2. Implicit/Widening/Automatic (we are going from bigger to smaller)
	short box1=250;
	int box2=box1;






If statements
	if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based
	on some condition and provided data.
	if condition
	if else condition
	if else if condition
	nested if else condition
	
	Why we should learn about if else conditions?
	When we are solving a real life problems like testing a web site, our program needs to make a lot of decisions.
	
	What is the syntax of if else conditions?
	if condition
	
	boolean rich=true;
	 
	 	if(rich)
	 	{
	 	System.out.println("Lets buy a house");
	 	}
	 	
	 	
	 	
For String we need to write equal to!
