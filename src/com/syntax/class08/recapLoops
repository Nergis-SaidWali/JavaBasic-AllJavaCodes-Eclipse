Why do we use loops?

to avoid repetition of codes
It repeats the block of code depending on my condition


Loops in Java:

while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop


for loop - when we know number of repetitions/iterations in advance
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	code to repeat
	}
	
	
	while loop and do while loop -> if we don't know the number of repetitions
	
	while loop checks the condition first and then executes
	do while loop executes and only then checks the condition
	
	syntax?
	
	while(boolean condition) {
	code to repeat;
	}
	
	do{
	code to repeat;
	}while(boolean condition);
	
	
	
	break - breaks the loop and it usually used inside some type of conditions
	
	
	
	
	
	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	nested loops -loop inside another loop
	
	for (int i=1; i<3; i++) {  ---> outer loop
		System.out.println("Hello");
		
		for(int j=1; j<=3; j++); { -----------> nested loop
		System.out.println("Bye");
		}
	}
