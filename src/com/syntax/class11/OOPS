What is an object?
	Everything around us is an object for example; keyboard, mouse, a glass of water, cell phone etc.
	Objects can be defined based on how they look and how they behave. Objects in computer programming are also very similar. 
	They have state(Which helps us define how that object looks like) and behaviors(What that object does).
