Loops:
	Loops in Java help us execute a piece of code again and again.
	
Why we should learn about loops?
	Because loops help us write cleaner and scalable code. If you have to test a password field on a web page, you can create different
	variations of data in an excel sheet. Then, you pick all the values one by one and test the field.

How many types of loops?
For loop
While loop
Do while loop
Enhanced for loop


For loop syntax:

	for(starting point; last point; step size) {
	Code to repeat
	}
